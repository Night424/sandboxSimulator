Project Overview
The Malware Sandbox Simulator is a safe and educational tool that mimics virus-like behaviour and detects it in real-time. It simulates what malicious software might do (file replication, startup injection, hidden files) and monitors the system for those behaviours in a sandboxed environment.
For educational and portfolio purposes only. No real malware is used or created.

Project Goals
â€¢	 Simulate real-world malware behaviours (harmlessly)
â€¢	Monitor file system and log suspicious activity
â€¢	Provide a user-friendly GUI for launching and viewing logs
â€¢	Teach malware analysis basics in a controlled, safe environment

Core Features
Feature	Description
Simulated Malware	Creates hidden files, copies itself, simulates registry write
Sandbox Monitor	Watches directories and logs malware-like actions
Logging System	Stores logs to file and displays in console or UI
Electron GUI	Interface to launch simulator, view logs, and control sandbox
Quarantine Folder	Detected files are optionally moved here

Team Member Responsibilities
Member 1 â€“ Simulated Malware Developer (Norytt)
â€¢	Create fake virus scripts (fakevirus.js)
â€¢	Simulate behaviors like:
o	Self-replication to startup
o	Hidden file creation
o	Fake "registry" JSON entry
o	Dummy payload (message, countdown, etc.)

Member 2 â€“ Sandbox Monitor (LilBayBey)
â€¢	Watch system directories using chokidar (Node.js) or watchdog (Python)
â€¢	Log detected file activity: create, delete, modify
â€¢	Optionally trigger alerts or move suspicious files to quarantine

Member 3 â€“ GUI Developer (Night)
â€¢	Build an Electron interface:
o	Buttons to launch malware sim
o	View logs in real-time
o	Open folders
â€¢	Style app with basic CSS (dark theme or terminal-like look)

# Malware Sandbox Simulator 
This is a safe and educational tool that simulates malware behavior and detects it in a sandboxed environment.
> For educational use only. No real malware is used or executed.

## Features
- Simulates self-copying, stealth files, and registry injection
- Monitors file changes and logs events in real-time
- Desktop GUI built with Electron
